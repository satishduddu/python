107. Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: We count 35 
heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many 
rabbits and how many chickens do we have?




def solve_puzzle(total_heads, total_legs):
    for num_chickens in range(total_heads + 1):
        num_rabbits = total_heads - num_chickens
        if (2 * num_chickens + 4 * num_rabbits) == total_legs:
            return num_chickens, num_rabbits
    return None


total_heads = 35
total_legs = 94


solution = solve_puzzle(total_heads, total_legs)


if solution:
    num_chickens, num_rabbits = solution
    print("Number of chickens:", num_chickens)
    print("Number of rabbits:", num_rabbits)
else:
    print("No solution found.")
