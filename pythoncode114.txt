114. You are given words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its 
number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input 
order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for 
clarification.
If the following string is given as input to the program:
4
bcdef
abcdefg
bcde
bcdef
Then, the output of the program should be:
3
2 1 1




from collections import OrderedDict


# Read the number of words
n = int(input("Enter the number of words: "))


# Create an ordered dictionary to maintain the order of appearance
word_count = OrderedDict()


# Read the words and count their occurrences
for _ in range(n):
    word = input("Enter a word: ")
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1


# Print the counts in the order of appearance
for count in word_count.values():
    print(count, end=' ')
